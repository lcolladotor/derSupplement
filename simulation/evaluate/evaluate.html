<p>This document is a work in progress.</p>
<p>Here we evaluate the performance of the different pipelines we used to analyze the simulated data. Evaluating the performance is tricky and depends on how you define the reference set. At this moment we are considering six options detailed later.</p>
<div id="setup" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Setup</h1>
<p>First, we load the required libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## Load required libraries
library('GenomicRanges')

library('knitr')
library('devtools')</code></pre>
<div id="load-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Load data</h2>
<p>Next we load the required data from the simulation setup as well as the statistical results from the different pipelines. We then format the results in a way that we can easily access them later on.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## Load simulation information
load(file.path('..', 'generateReads', 'simulation_info.Rdata'))

<li>Transcript level with exons grouped by the transcript they belong to. A transcript is marked as differentially expressed (DE) if it’s expression was set to be low or high. This ignores whether the transcript in question overlaps other transcripts from the same gene and the status assigned to them.</li>
<li>Transcripts (exons grouped by transcript) with the DE status dependent on other transcripts from the same gene. If any transcript for a given gene is set to low or high expression, all the transcripts of that gene are marked as differentially expressed.</li>
<li>Exon level with DE status given by whether the exon overlaps any transcript with low or high expression. Note that two transcripts share the same exon, that exon will appear twice in this reference set.</li>
<li>Disjoint exon level with DE status given by whether the disjoint exon segment overlaps any transcript with low or high expression. This reference set is smaller than the previous one because if two transcripts share the same exon, that exon will only appear once in this reference set.</li>

<p>From these summaries we can see that in most cases the minimum and maximum values are nearly the same, with more variability for the <code>HISAT</code> -&gt; <code>StringTie</code> -&gt; <code>ballgown</code> pipeline results. Note that for this pipeline we conducted tests at the transcript level (StatMethod = <code>ballgown-trans</code>) and at the exon level (<code>ballgown-exon</code>). <code>edgeR</code> achieves slightly greater empirical power than <code>DESeq2</code> at the cost of a higher empirical FPR and FDR.</p>
<p>The sets where we consider exons or exon segments overlapping only 1 transcript show a clear difference in power for the methods that rely on annotation between the analyses that used the complete annotation and those that used the incomplete one. The <code>derfinder</code> analyses do have higher FPR and FDR than other pipelines, but achieve nearly the same power as the other methods when the annotation is complete.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Specific case</h2>
<p>In this section we focus on the specific case of using <code>HISAT</code> -&gt; <code>derfinder</code> -&gt; <code>edgeR</code> from the first replicate because it has the highest empirical FPR from all the <code>derfinder</code> analyses when using either of the exon reference sets (row 20 in the last two tables).</p>
<p>Note how when using the transcript level information as reference, most of the false positives (1583 out of 1994) are from the case <code>someDE</code>. That is, from genes that have multiple transcripts and at least one of them is DE. These false positives go away when using as the reference the transcripts with DE status by gene (second table). In that scenario, most of the remaining false positives are from the <code>noneDE</code> case, where about half of them are correctly detected as negatives (307 / 649).</p>
<p>When using the exon level reference set (third table), only about a tenth [(37 + 642) / 6018 = 11.28%] of the <code>noneDE</code> cases are incorrectly labeled. The numbers are similar in the disjoint exon segments reference set (fourth table): [(9 + 304) / 2864 = 10.93%]</p>

<p>The transcript level sets have much higher false positives than the exon level sets, however, the exon level sets have increase false negatives. In both the exons and disjoint exon segments reference sets, most of the false negatives are from the <code>someDE</code> scenario. Those are ambiguous cases and it’s the main reason why the power is decreased when using these reference sets. Note how the percent of total reference units from the <code>someDE</code> case that result in false negatives decreases from 19.76 to 10.59 between the exons set that does not take into account multiplicity and the disjoint exons set.</p>
<p>The percent of false negatives is further decreased on the exon and disjoint exon segment sets subsetted to those that overlap only 1 transcript. That is, the reference units where there is no ambiguity in terms of the the assignment of the DE status.</p>
